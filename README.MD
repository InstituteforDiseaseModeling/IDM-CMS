# IDM Compartmental Modeling Software

This software has the following features:

 * Multiple solvers
 * Multiple output formats
 * Simple JSON configuration
 * Text based model specification

Here is a sample configuration: :+1:

```javascript
{
    "duration" : 3650,
    "runs" : 1,
    "samples" : 3650,
    "solver" : "R",
    "output" : {
        "headers" : true
    },
    "tau-leaping" : {
        "epsilon" : 0.01
    },
    "r-leaping" : {}
}
```

Here is a sample model file:

```Scheme
; simplemodel

(import (rnrs) (emodl cmslib))

(start-model "seir.emodl")

(species S 990)
(species E)
(species I 10)
(species R)

(observe susceptible S)
(observe exposed     E)
(observe infectious  I)
(observe recovered   R)

(param Ki 0.0005)
(param Kl 0.2)
(param Kr (/ 1 7))
(param Kw (/ 1 135))

(reaction exposure   (S I) (E I) (* Ki S I))
(reaction infection  (E)   (I)   (* Kl E))
(reaction recovery   (I)   (R)   (* Kr I))
(reaction waning     (R)   (S)   (* Kw R))

(end-model)
```
