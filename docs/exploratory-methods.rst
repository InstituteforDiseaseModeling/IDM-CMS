Exploratory methods
====================

The |CMS_s| framework is designed to enable efficient prototyping of new methods. A new solver can be easily implemented by extending the base solver. Below we list four prototype methods included in the CMS. We note that solvers
in this category are included as an example of ongoing method development and are not currently supported by the developers.
