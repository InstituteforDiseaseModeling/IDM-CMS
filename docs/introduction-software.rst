=============================
Introduction to the software
=============================

|CMS_l| is a :term:`stochastic` :term:`compartmental model` that is simpler to configure and faster
to run than an agent-based model like |EMOD_s|, while more suitable to modeling low probability
events than a :term:`deterministic` compartmental model. |CMS_s| has multiple solvers and output
formats available and uses a simple text-based model specification and simulation configuration.

|CMS_s| is provided to the research community to help advance the understanding of disease dynamics.
|IDM_s| does not provide the same level of support for |CMS_s| as it does for |EMOD_s|; however, if
you encounter any issues while using |CMS_s|, please contact support@idmod.org and we will help if
able.
