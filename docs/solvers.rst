Solvers
========

The |CMS_s| software offers 16 different solvers. They can be categorized into the following
categories. The best :term:`solver` to use will depend up on the disease and data you are
simulating. Note that all solver names are case-insensitive in their corresponding .cfg file. If you
do not specify a solver, :doc:`gillespie` will be used.
